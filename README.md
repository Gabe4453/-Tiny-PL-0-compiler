# -Tiny-PL-0-compiler

/*
This is a C code compiler or interpreter for a programming language. It includes the implementation of a lexical analyzer, a symbol table, and an assembly code generator for a fictional language. The code defines structures for tokens, symbols, and assembly instructions. It also contains functions for processing constants, variables, and procedures, as well as for handling expressions, statements, and program blocks. The program reads source code from a file, tokenizes it, and generates assembly code based on the input. Additionally, there are functions for printing the generated assembly code and the symbol table.
